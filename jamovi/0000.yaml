  Analyses that calculate the log likelihood ratio (support) for a  range of
  statistical tests. Where possible the likelihood function and support interval
  for the observed data are displayed. Intended as a companion to the book <a

      Independent samples analysis where null and alternative hypotheses canbe
      specified. Likelihood interval support level can be specified and plotted
      with the means. A likelihood function for the difference in means can be
      plotted.

      Sample size calculation for all t-tests, specifying strength of evidence
      required, the probability of misleading and weak evidence, and the effect
      size. Shows a probability plot of types of error against sample size.

    menuSubgroup: ANOVA
    description: |
      The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is used to explore the relationship
      between a continuous dependent variable, and one or more categorical
      explanatory variables. This 'One-Way ANOVA' is a simplified version of
      the 'normal' ANOVA, allowing only a single explanatory factor and.
      dependent variables. Contrasts can be specified whose weights should sum
      to zero, but do not need to be orthogonal to each other. Support values, 
      S, represent log likelihood ratio. They are given for each model 
      comparison. Sc represent Akaike corrected values according to the 
      number of parameters

    description: >
      The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is used to explore the relationship
      between a continuous dependent variable and two categorical explanatory
      variables. Contrasts can be specified. Support values can be corrected
      according to the number of parameters in the models being compared.

    menuTitle: Repeated Measures ANOVA
    menuSubgroup: ANOVA
    description: |-
      The Repeated Measures ANOVA is used to explore the relationship
      between a continuous dependent variable and one or two categorical
      explanatory variables, where one or more of the explanatory variables
      are 'within subjects' (where multiple measurements are from the same
      subject).

    menuGroup: jeva
    menuSubgroup: Regression & Correlation
    menuTitle: Polynomial Regression
    description: >
      Polynomial regression of two variables where different orders are
      compared. Akaike corrected support values are calculated hierarchically.
      R-squared and AIC values are given. P values are calculated in the usual
      way from the residual mean sums of squares from the highest polynomial in
      the model, but these are not comparable with the support values. Model
      coefficients are given with their specified likelihood support level.
      Plots for different polynomial orders can be plotted.
